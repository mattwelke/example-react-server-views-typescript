Finished code for the blog post "Strongly-Typed, Server-Rendered Views with React and TypeScript".

## Setup

1. Make sure you've got Node.js installed on your machine. [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) is a great way to do that.
2. In the project directory, run `yarn` or `npm install`.
3. In the project directory, run `./node_modules/typescript/bin/tsc` to compile the app.
4. In the project directory, run `node dist/main.js` to run the app.

Note that IDEs such as Visual Studio Code and WebStorm will perform certain steps that will make some of the above steps unneccessary. When in doubt, consult the documentation for your tools.
